*"Give me a 90-day roadmap to become a fluent English speaker.

My goal is to speak like a pro with confidence, especially in DevOps/IT professional communication (stand-ups, client calls, interviews, presentations).

Break the roadmap into daily and weekly routines (1 hour per day).

Cover all key areas:

Grammar & Vocabulary – strong foundation with daily practice.

Speaking Fluency – real conversations, shadowing, role plays.

Listening & Pronunciation – improve accent and clarity.

Professional English – emails, meetings, technical discussions.

DevOps Context Practice – explain pipelines, deployments, troubleshooting in fluent English.

Confidence-building habits – thinking in English, mirror practice, recording.

Progress Milestones – checkpoints at 30, 60, and 90 days.

Add common mistakes Indian learners make and how to fix them.

Present the roadmap in a tabular format (Day/Week → Task → Outcome).

At the end, suggest books, podcasts, and tools/apps I can use."*
